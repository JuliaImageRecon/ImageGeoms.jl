## Overview

This module exports a composite type `ImageGeom`
and corresponding constructors
for describing the image sampling geometry
for (typically tomographic) image reconstruction.

It is used in the
Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox
[(MIRT)](https://github.com/JeffFessler/MIRT.jl).

See the "examples" tab for explanations.

In [(MIRT)](https://github.com/JeffFessler/MIRT.jl)
there currently is an older interface `image_geom`
similar to the function of the same name in
[the Matlab version of MIRT](https://github.com/JeffFessler/mirt)
provided for backward compatibility.
Using `ImageGeom` is recommended for Julia work.
